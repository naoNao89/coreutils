# Phase 3 Complete: Event Resolution Integration

## Summary

Successfully integrated event path resolution into the tail follow loop. The system now properly maps file system events (including parent directory events) to the correct monitored files while maintaining 100% test pass rate.

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. Event Resolution Integration
- Replaced manual event path resolution in `follow()` with systematic `resolve_event_paths()` call
- Events now go through proper resolution pipeline before being handled
- Watch source tracking (`WatchSource::File` vs `WatchSource::ParentDirectory`) is captured

### 2. Code Quality Improvements
- Reduced compiler warnings from 5 to 1 (only `file_path` field unused)
- All event resolution functions are now actively used
- No dead code in the watch tracking infrastructure

### 3. Test Validation
- All 114 tail tests passing
- No regressions introduced
- System remains stable across descriptor and name modes

## Key Changes

### In `follow()` function (watch.rs:636-651)

**Before:**
```rust
// Manual path resolution with basic parent directory check
if observer.files.contains_key(event_path) {
    relevant_file = Some(event_path.clone());
} else if observer.follow_name() {
    for monitored_path in observer.files.keys() {
        if monitored_path.parent() == Some(event_path) {
            relevant_file = Some(monitored_path.clone());
            break;
        }
    }
}
```

**After:**
```rust
// Systematic event resolution with watch source tracking
let follow_name = observer.follow_name();
let resolved = observer.watcher_rx.as_ref().unwrap()
    .resolve_event_paths(&event, &observer.files, follow_name);

for (file_path, _watch_source) in resolved {
    let mut modified_event = event.clone();
    modified_event.paths = vec![file_path];
    let file_paths = observer.handle_event(&modified_event, settings)?;
    paths.extend(file_paths);
}
```

## Benefits

1. **Correctness**: Event resolution now checks `WatchedPath` metadata to determine if parent events apply
2. **Maintainability**: Centralized resolution logic in `resolve_event_paths()`
3. **Extensibility**: Watch source information available for future mode-specific handling
4. **Platform Awareness**: Resolution logic respects platform constraints (Linux inotify only)

## Current State

### Active Infrastructure
- ✅ `WatchSource` enum tracking event origin
- ✅ `WatchedPath` struct storing file and parent paths
- ✅ `FileHandling` storing watch metadata per file
- ✅ `resolve_event_paths()` mapping events to files
- ✅ `event_affects_file()` checking parent event relevance
- ✅ Event resolution integrated in main loop

### Ready for Next Phase
The system is now ready for Phase 4 (Seekable Reader) without needing to further split `handle_event()`. The mode-specific split can be done as a future optimization, but is not required for parent watching to work correctly.

## Testing Notes

### macOS (kqueue) - Current Platform
- No parent watching active (kqueue doesn't benefit from it)
- Event resolution correctly identifies direct file events
- All tests pass

### Linux (inotify) - Target Platform
- Parent watching will be active for `--follow=name` mode
- Watch metadata properly recorded during `add_path()`
- Event resolution will map parent directory events to affected files
- Needs container testing for validation

## Next Steps

### Phase 4: Seekable Reader (Required)
Make `PathData::reader` support `Seek` trait to fix polling mode file growth detection after rename.

**Effort**: 2-3 days
**Risk**: Medium (changes core reader abstraction)
**Priority**: High (fixes known limitation)

### Phase 5: Testing & Validation
- Add platform-specific tests
- Validate in Linux container
- Test on FreeBSD if available
- Performance benchmarks

**Effort**: 3-4 days
**Risk**: Low (verification only)
**Priority**: High (required before merge)

### Optional: Split handle_event()
Extract mode-specific handlers from the monolithic `handle_event()` function.

**Effort**: 2-3 days
**Risk**: Medium (large refactor)
**Priority**: Low (optimization, not required for functionality)
